# MF_Friction
Numerical investigations of a Mean Field model describing collective phenomena at frictional interfaces.

We pointed out that local neighbours were key to model the avalanche dynamics and the so-called pseudo-gap in the distribution of "distance to breaking point" . A future work could investigate whether mimicking the effect of a small number of neighbours (by manually adding noise to each particle while keeping a MeanField approach) can replicate complex finite element simulations.
